# minecraft-stronghold-finder
This program calculates the location of a Minecraft stronghold by triangulating the position from two Eye of Ender throws. It uses the intersection of the two directional lines based on their coordinates and angles to estimate the strongholdâ€™s location.

# How to Use

### 1. Throw the First Eye of Ender

Throw an Eye of Ender in any direction and **position the crosshair directly on it** as it flies.
Press **F3 + C** to copy the location information (coordinates and angles) to your clipboard.

### 2. Throw the Second Eye of Ender

## NOTE:
- At long distances, small errors in positioning the crosshair can affect the accuracy of the estimate. Make sure to aim carefully when copying the location data.
